# robot-arm-opencv

Unedited and uncleaned code for my robot arm project using OpenCV and Arduino. The python file uses OpenCV to calibrate and track the movements of an object of chosen color. These movements are fed through a serial USB connection to the Arduino with servos attached.

Note: The Arduino ServoControl.ino file is not written by me!
